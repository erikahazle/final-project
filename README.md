#MyKitchenGarden

This is my final project for Web Development Immersive course at General Assembly. For this project, I had to work independently to come up with an idea and choose technology to make it a reality.

I wanted to create a website that made online shopping experience fun and memorable. MyKitchenGarden allows users to build their own herb kits rather than buying ready-made sets. By choosing different planters and herbs, users are able to create and visualise their herb kit.

I created this app using Rails API and Backbone.js as I felt that this would allow me to challenge myself by doing something I that have not done previously. To create interactive herb kits, I utilised SVG objects.
